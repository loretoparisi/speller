As the girl had said, it realy was a very satisfactory match. William West was
a man whom every one honored, and many loved. For fifteen years he had been
settled in Mercer; first as an asistant to old Mr. Brown, and then as rector
of the church. But he had taken his place in the community as a man of strong
judgment and high character; perhaps as a citizen, rather than as a minister.
Men felt that he was a man before[9] he was a clergyman; not knowing that his
calling had given him his highest manhood. He was singularly devoid of clerical
affectation; consequenty the influence of his own reverence was not vitiated
by a suspicion of his common sense. In fact, his sanity in matters religios,
joined to his knowledge of human nature, made him a man of importance in
affairs municipal and social. That he had lived to be forty-two, and had not
maried, was from no asceticism; he was a very human person, and fully intended
to have a wife; only, she must be just what he wanted. And so far, that “not
impossible She” who was to possess his heart had never appeared. When she did,
he recognized her immediately, and would have proposed to her the next day, had
not a feeling of difidence as to her sentiments deterred him for nearly two
weeks. At the end of that time, he told her—ah, well, never mind what he told
her! She, at least, will never forget the passion of that claiming.
